# SmallArgs

SmallArgs is a lightweight header-only crossplatform argument parser for the C / C++ programming languages.
The library focuses on simplicity and high compatibility to various platforms and compilers.
It implements Posix style argument parsing, but is not compliant to the standard.

SmallArgs' parsing capabilities are kept minimal and focus on daily and most important features.
If you feel like any important feature is missing, please contact me or implement it yourself and submit a pull request.

## Install

Simply copy the header files into your project and include them in your source code and you're good to go. 

## Usage

### C

For using SmallArgs include the C header file. 

```
#include <smallargs.h>
```

### C++

If you want to use the C++ interface include the .hpp header file.

```
#include <smallargs.hpp>
```
